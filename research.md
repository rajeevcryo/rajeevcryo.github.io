# Research

## ðŸ”¬ Overview

My research centers on understanding the evolution of glacial lakes and associated hazards, particularly Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), in the Sikkim Himalaya. I use remote sensing, GIS, and field-based approaches to monitor lake dynamics and assess climate-induced changes in fragile mountain ecosystems.

## Key Themes

### 1. Glacial Lake Evolution
- Mapping and monitoring glacial lakes using multi-temporal satellite imagery
- Analyzing spatial expansion trends and climate sensitivity
- Bathymetric and geophysical profiling of glacial lakes

### 2. GLOF Hazard Assessment
- Risk zonation using Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
- Identification of high-risk lakes using morphometric and hydrological indicators
- GLOF modeling and impact forecasting

### 3. Remote Sensing and Geospatial Tools
- Image classification using Sentinel, Landsat, and PlanetScope data
- Analysis with Google Earth Engine (GEE), QGIS, and ArcGIS
- Integration of UAV/drone data with satellite observations

### 4. Field Research
- Expeditions to high-altitude glacial lake regions in Sikkim and Ladakh
- On-site measurements of lake depth, sediment cores, and geomorphic features
- Collaborations with local authorities for community risk awareness
